## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Madison Elisabeth Enda, and I am a 23-year-old aspiring biological oceanographer and coastal ecologist from Los Angeles, CA. Ultimately, Iâ€™d love to join a lab or research team in marine ecology or biological oceanography, and work to preserve and protect coastal environments worldwide. I am particularly interested in analyzing the effects of anthropogenic stressors on coral reef ecosystems, investigating how physical and biological factors influence population structure and using mathematical modeling to predict the rate of adaptation in marine foundation species.
- I am currently pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in environmental data science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In the near future, I hope to use the data science skills I develop through this program for geospatial modeling of coastal ecosystems, to assist in environmental management and the efficiency of restoration projects.
