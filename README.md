## Hi there! 👋

- My name is Madison Enda, and I am currently working as a researcher and data scientist for the the FWCC Fish & Wildlife Institute's Coral Research Program. My work involves managing long-term ecological monitoring data sets on coral reef health, demography, biomass, and environmental conditions (temperature), as well as synthesizing reports and research utilizing this wealth of information. My background in marine biology and coastal environmental studies helps contextualize the design of my products and identify the utility and scope of my results. I am very excited about the deliverables currently on my 2026 agenda, most of which will beposted on the FWRI CRP website.

- I am also looking forward to brining my geospatial skills from previous projects to my current position! I love geospatial analysis as both an analytical and creative tool: uncovering patterns, testing ideas, and building visualizations that make complex ecological and demographic data easier to explore.
